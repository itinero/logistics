Main TODO's:

**conceptual todo's**:

The main thing left to think about is how to elegantly handle turning costs:

- Can we combine or reuse existing methods of solving?
- Can we perhaps use a regular solver and then 'add' in turning costs after?
- Can we optmize a fixed sequence efficiÃ«ntly (related to above).

**make sure to check to TODO's in the code**

Known issues:
- The directed weight matrix can still contain invalid visits or some visit pairs cannot be reached.
- The directed turn optimization operation can't handle invalid visits, it never succeeds.
- The directed 3opt can't handle open problem, we should use the closed equivalence there.
- The STSP solver uses 3OPt and can't handle open problems, we should use the closed equivalence there.
- wechelderzande CVRP-ND won't solve when paralell options is on. HINT: probably due to the size of the problem.
- idem STSP.

General todos:
- 3Opt uses NN when set to false, should be true.
- nearest neighbours still return '10' when there are less than 10 visits.
- Convert *all* TSP solvers to solvers that can handle sub-problems of matrices.
- Take into account visit costs in all solvers.

- Unittest solver registry and solverhooks.
- Unittest model mappers.
- Unittest model validation and implement if needed.
- Make sure the public API makes sense, internalize everything except what we can use in solvers/strategies.
   - We can verify this by implement or starting a BWaste-specific implementation.
- Unittest Shared.CheapestInsertion or verify that is tested.
- Unittest Shared.HillClimbing3Opt or verify that it is tested.
- Remove explicit reference on Reminiscence once Itinero is published.
- Implement nice tostring on the model objects.
- Add the travel weight and visit weights to TSP's.
- Have an other look at sequences and seq and their usage in the exchange operator.
- Create a way to update first of a tour (and use this in swap).
- Test CVRP solver with a 'null' arrival location.
- local2shift for time windows:
  - Implement a best-improvement version of the local1shift operator for timewindows. Currently it's first-improvement.
  - Make sure this is compatible with visit-lists and cases where the problem has more visits than the solution. This is needed for use in an STSP for example.
- Fix performance issues in EAX.
- code review:
   - C# 7.3 features everywhere!
   - customers no, visits yes!
   - only use 'time' on timewindow-specific stuff, otherwise use weight.
   - don't forget tests.
- change resulting stop meta in routes using:
   - visit: the visit id from the original model.
   - index: remove the index, it's confusing.
   - position: the position in the current tour.
 - TimeWindows:
   - Unify unlimited and IsEmpty.
 - Functional tests: conver all problems in CVRP and CVRP-ND.
 - Implement intermediate results handling on all solvers.
 
 
Ideas direction-enabled solvers:
- See if there is **really really** not a way to unify solvers and have directed optional.
- Implement a tour specificially for directed tours. 
- Implement a turn-optimizing version of 3Opt.

Ideas for speeding up tour():

 - Implement an O(1) contains, this can be done by always proper resetting NEXT.
 - Then it's very fast to update contains on insertafter for example and that also becomes O(1).

Ideas for speeding up GA:

 - Use multithreading everywhere but make sure not to use multiple operators on the same candidate at the same time.

Ideas for speeding up CI:

 - Limit the visits being considered to only nearest neighbours.
 - Don't use pair but GetNext() on tour, this way we can exclude visits too far 'from' first before even considering 'to'.
 
General ideas:
 - See if we can (quickly) figure out if the shortest path between two locations is along other locations.
 - Build a generic highly optimized tour building heuristic based on CI and 3OPT.

 ## Notes on TSP-TW
 
 - The timewindow concept is too simple, we need a new concept to describe:
   - Positive or negative windows.
   - Multiple windows or 'periods' per visit.
 - The TSP-TW solver fails while solutions are clearly possible.
